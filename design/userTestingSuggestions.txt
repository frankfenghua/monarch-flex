* the graph controls should be in always visible.
* label the graph lines clearly: always visible legend or on lines themselves.
* Need context sensitive help on the accordian because:
  * the sliders are not easily understandable 
  * "websites in community" is not understandable in the accordian.
* change "goodness" to "sentiment".
* ask for the password twice when registering.
* have a defalt added innocuous community under "my communities" for new users.
* Matt doesn't like the word "spoken" in the accordian. (generally, focus on
  using clearer language)
* the accordian needs to be split up into two groups: keywords/links & graph controls/websites in community.
  * Ideas: make legend that also allows for editing of keywords and links shown
    in graph
* change eye icon to a magnifying glass (or something suggesting "drilling
  down" into a website).
* when you log-in, stay on the homepage.
* Incorporate "My Communities" and "Other Communities" links into the homepagee
* combine the two registration steps.
