<font size=-1><div dir="ltr">Hi everyone,<br>I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to do any coding in Java but have found two active open source projects that look intriguing:<br><br><a href="http://grub.org" target="_blank">grub</a> : open source architecture which uses a peer-to-peer client to facilitate distributed crawling. I think it&#39;s pretty cool. We&#39;d probably have to modify the actual code because I think its aim is to provide a general crawler for a search engine. Something worth looking into. <br>
<br><a href="http://crawler.archive.org/" target="_blank">Heritrix</a> : from the web site: &quot;the Internet Archive&#39;s open-source, extensible,
web-scale, archival-quality web crawler project&quot;<br>             <b>pros</b>: has API for defining crawl behavior and defining what to do with collected data; multi-threaded; respects robots.txt; proceeds without overloading any single server; various add-ons including the Heritrix Cluster Controller which allows for the coordination of distinct instances of the crawler running on multiple machines.<br>
<br>I think both of these projects seem interesting. Using and/or modifying either one would require us to read code and maybe learn something. They already implement politeness protocols (robots.txt and prevention of overload), are multi-threaded, and allow for scalability through distributed computing. Just starting from scratch, we could probably get something working quickly but it would not have all these features.<br>
<br>Also, what&#39;s the status of the requirements document? Mariusz, have you made that change that you were going to make? Whoever has the latest version, could you circulate it, please? <br><br><br>See you tomorrow,<br>

<u><br>
Requirements Document v0.1</u></font><br>
<br>
<b>What is it?</b><br>
<br>
Our
project is a Community Analysis Tool that will analyze online
communities like forums, blogs, and news sites, and provide a user with
a way of viewing the resulting data. We are completing this project for
our liaison at Adobe, Puneet Goel, within the context of the course, CS
492/493: Senior Project in CS, at the University of Illinois.  <br>
Our deliverable will be the source code and any associated
documentation that we have generated. Specifically, the project will
include a server-side portion which is responsible for spidering and
populating a database with relevant information and a separate
client-side portion which may run on a different machine. The client
will be used by a user to communicate with the database server in order
to retrieve community analysis results. Some of the data analysis may
also be done on the client side. Upon our completion of a prototype
system, the goal is to open-source the project.<br>
<br>
<b>What is needed?</b><br>
<br>
The only requirement up to this point
is that we create an application that uses Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR
technologies to display results of web community analysis. This
requirement implies that we also must create a program for collecting
and analyzing community data and a way of serving out this data.
Additional concrete needs have yet to be laid down.<br>
<br>
<b>What is wanted?</b><br>
<br>
On the user side, this application
will provide various forms of data visualization, like plots and pie
graphs, in an attractive desktop application. Viewable statistics may
include things like community activity surrounding a given keyword,
popular keywords, the number of posts per day, posting activity of
users, and various other trends that may be assessed through page
source analysis. <br>
<b><br>What has already been done?</b><br>
<br>
Our liaison at Adobe has
stated that this is a project in its early infancy so there is no
existing source. However, project advisors suggested that we look into
Google and Yahoo open-source technologies as possible starting points
for implementation of the web-crawling capabilities required in our
program. As another consequence of the recent conception of our
project, our team will be responsible for drafting a design document
from scratch that includes a list of required features and desired
features. <br>
<br>
<b>Why?</b><br>
<br>
There are two motivations for building this community analysis tool:<br>
 (1)
Puneet, the product marketing manager of Flex and Air, wants his
products to be used in universities. He hopes that we can demonstrate
the utility and power of these products in our application.<br>
 (2) This tool could be useful for several types of users, both within
Adobe and outside of Adobe. For examples, researchers could use it to
understand human behavior on the web or marketing executives could use
it to find out what hot products people are most interested in. In
addition to these, there are a wide range of scenarios in which a
community analysis tool could be applied.<br>
<br>
<b>What tools (hardware or software) do we require?</b><br>
<br>
Adobe
was not willing to provide their Master Collection to us for the
completion of this project, nor were they certain that they could
provide us a dedicated server. We will need one or more fairly powerful
machines to do web-crawling tasks periodically and serve many requests
very quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>Limitations</b><br>
<br>
Our tool will not be able to analyze
cross-community interdependencies involving specific users. It is too
difficult to determine whether two accounts on two forums are the same
person. For example, John Smith could have the screen name LeetHaxor on
a computer forum while he could have the screen name Dominator999 on an
MMORPG forum. We would not be able to aggregate the stats of this
person across both forums.<br>
Because the web is so free form, every community will have differing
HTML structure. For example, one news site could write its titles as
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free&lt;/b&gt; Adobe Master Collection&lt;/h1&gt;,
whereas another news site could write theirs as &lt;div
class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Free Adobe Master Collection&lt;/div&gt;. It would be
nearly impossible to write a single algorithm to parse any website
given to us. There are just too many coding variations. Instead, we
will develop a plug-in system by which the structure of a website may
be described. Using a plug-in developed for a specific site, our server
will be able to collect data from the site and populate its database
correctly. In the future, if websites want to be included into our
analysis tool, they could supply their own plug-in or these plug-ins
may also be supplied by users.<div style='padding:5 0'><font size=1 color=#888888>[Quoted text hidden]</font></div></div>
