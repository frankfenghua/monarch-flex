I can do the part where data is given to Flex and I can help you with some Photoshop and Flash stuff.<br>

<br><br><br>For <b><span style="color:rgb(204, 0, 0)">Andrew</span></b> to revise:<br><b><br></b><div style="text-align:center"><u><font size="4">Requirements Rough Draft</font></u><br></div><b>What is it?</b><br><br>
The Adobe project will analyze online communities, such as forums, blogs, and news sites. It will generate various statistics such as who is the most active poster, who has answered the most questions, reoccurring hot keywords, the number of posts per day, and various other trends. Users will be able to install desktop programs to view up to date statistics about communities which this project has. Stats will be displayed in charts, pie graphs, etc... After the project is finished, it will be turned into a non-profit open source project.<br>
<br><b>Sponsor&#39;s involvement</b><br>
<br>
Our liason at Adobe has stated that this is a project in its infancy. 
There is no existing code they could provide that we can build off of. 
However, our liason suggested us to study Google&#39;s parsing and spidering techniques as a starting point. Our team will be responsible for drafting a project outline.  We will
decide on the feature list and they will approve of it. Adobe is also
too cheap to supply the $5,000 Master Collection which we asked for, so
we will have to use Microsoft Paint to draw our graphics (pixel by pixel).<br><br>The Adobe Flex and Air teams are located in California, so development will occur only in Illinois. We will use our own computers, but they will supply a dedicated server (I hope).<br>
<br><b>Why are we making it?</b><br><br>There are two motivations for completing this community analysis project. The first is that the product marketing manager of Flex and Air, Puneet Goel, wants to have these two Adobe technologies introduced into the college environment.  He wants us to demonstrate the power of Flex and Air to attrack more computer science students to use them.  So far this is the only requirement set in stone.<br>
<br>The second reason is to have a tool for any kind of researcher to use to understand human behavior on the web. For example, sociology students would analyze how people of different countries interact within one online community. Marketing executives could find out what hot products people are most interested in. There are an endless number of other research areas which could use the Adobe community analysis tool.<br>
<br><b>Limitations</b><br><br>Our tool will not be able to analyze cross-community interdependencies. It is too difficult to determine whether two accounts on two forums are the same person. For example, John Smith could have the screenname LeetHaxor on a computer fourm while he could have the screenname Dominator999 on a MMORPG forum. We would not be able to aggregate the stats of this person across both forums. <br>
<br>Because the web is so free form, every community will have differing HTML structure. For example, one news site could write its titles as &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free&lt;/b&gt; Adobe Master Collection&lt;/h1&gt;, wearas another news site could write theirs as &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Free Adobe Master Collection&lt;/div&gt;. It would be nearly impossible to write a single algorithm to parse any website given to us. There are just too many coding variations. Instead, we will be writing plugins for only certain communities after we analyze their structure manually. In the future, if websites want to be included into our analysis tool, they could supply their own plugin.<br>

<font size=-1>That's sounds good. Once I have some understanding of Flex I'll write some proof of concept code and try to interface it with a Java or C++ application which writes out XML files. I'll try to have something by early next week so we can discuss the pros and cons.<br />

<font size=-1><div dir="ltr">Ryan,<br>I&#39;ll try to revise the Requirements by sometime this afternoon. It looks pretty good, though.<br><br>All,<br>I think our first step should be listing out all the types of community information that may be useful/relevant. I found this paper just now that may or may not have some ideas that we could use:<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2007.org%2Fpapers%2Fpaper516.pdf&amp;ei=TN7PSMb3J46wgwLn6cyVAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqZtWGL9805206Iihda1KCdFEEdw&amp;sig2=bPxClknfnRiN3gduDPu1dw" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/url?sa=<WBR>t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=<WBR>http%3A%2F%2Fwww2007.org%<WBR>2Fpapers%2Fpaper516.pdf&amp;ei=<WBR>TN7PSMb3J46wgwLn6cyVAw&amp;usg=<WBR>AFQjCNEqZtWGL9805206Iihda1KCdF<WBR>EEdw&amp;sig2=<WBR>bPxClknfnRiN3gduDPu1dw</a><br>
<br>The DB schema should be designed based on what type of information we want to be able to get quickly from the DB. I think we should pick some specific forum, social network, or blog and try to get something working with that. Then we could try to generalize and construct a plug-in system to allow it to work with other sites. These plug-ins would be server-side. I guess we&#39;ll discuss all this when we meet on Wed.<br>

<font size=-1><div dir="ltr"><b></b><div style="text-align:center"><div style="text-align:left"><font size="2">Ryan,<br>Here is my revised copy. I added some content and rearranged some things but I&#39;m not sure this is any better than what you had. I enjoyed the comment about the Master Collection but I had to change it a bit. Edit it however you want, send it back, and I&#39;ll put it into LaTeX and print it for tomorrow. <br>
</font></div><font size="4"><u><br>Requirements Document v0.1</u></font><br></div><br><b>What is it?</b><br><br>Our project is a Community Analysis Tool that will analyze online communities like forums, blogs, and news sites, and provide a user with a way of viewing the resulting data. We are completing this project for our liaison at Adobe, Puneet Goel, within the context of the course, CS 492/493: Senior Project in CS, at the University of Illinois.  <br>
Our deliverable will be the source code and any associated documentation that we have generated. Specifically, the project will include a server-side portion which is responsible for spidering and populating a database with relevant information and a separate client-side portion which may run on a different machine. The client will be used by a user to communicate with the database server in order to retrieve community analysis results. Some of the data analysis may also be done on the client side. Upon our completion of a prototype system, the goal is to open-source the project.<br>
<br><b>What is needed?</b><br><br>The only requirement up to this point is that we create an application that uses Adobe Flex and Adobe AIR technologies to display results of web community analysis. This requirement implies that we also must create a program for collecting and analyzing community data and a way of serving out this data. Additional concrete needs have yet to be laid down.<br>
<br><b>What is wanted?</b><br><br>On the user side, this application will provide various forms of data visualization, like plots and pie graphs, in an attractive desktop application. Viewable statistics may include things like community activity surrounding a given keyword, popular keywords, the number of posts per day, posting activity of users, and various other trends that may be assessed through page source analysis. <br>
<b><br>What has already been done?</b><br><br>Our liaison at Adobe has stated that this is a project in its early infancy so there is no existing source. However, project advisors suggested that we look into Google and Yahoo open-source technologies as possible starting points for implementation of the web-crawling capabilities required in our program. As another consequence of the recent conception of our project, our team will be responsible for drafting a design document from scratch that includes a list of required features and desired features. <br>
<br><b>Why?</b><br><br>There are two motivations for building this community analysis tool:<br> (1) Puneet, the product marketing manager of Flex and Air, wants his products to be used in universities. He hopes that we can demonstrate the utility and power of these products in our application.<br>
 (2) This tool could be useful for several types of users, both within Adobe and outside of Adobe. For examples, researchers could use it to understand human behavior on the web or marketing executives could use it to find out what hot products people are most interested in. In addition to these, there are a wide range of scenarios in which a community analysis tool could be applied.<br>
<br><b>What tools (hardware or software) do we require?</b><br><br>Adobe was not willing to provide their Master Collection to us for the completion of this project, nor were they certain that they could provide us a dedicated server. We will need one or more fairly powerful machines to do web-crawling tasks periodically and serve many requests very quickly.<br>
<br><b>Limitations</b><br><br>Our tool will not be able to analyze cross-community interdependencies involving specific users. It is too difficult to determine whether two accounts on two forums are the same person. For example, John Smith could have the screen name LeetHaxor on a computer forum while he could have the screen name Dominator999 on an MMORPG forum. We would not be able to aggregate the stats of this person across both forums.<br>
Because the web is so free form, every community will have differing HTML structure. For example, one news site could write its titles as &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free&lt;/b&gt; Adobe Master Collection&lt;/h1&gt;, whereas another news site could write theirs as &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Free Adobe Master Collection&lt;/div&gt;. It would be nearly impossible to write a single algorithm to parse any website given to us. There are just too many coding variations. Instead, we will develop a plug-in system by which the structure of a website may be described. Using a plug-in developed for a specific site, our server will be able to collect data from the site and populate its database correctly. In the future, if websites want to be included into our analysis tool, they could supply their own plug-in or these plug-ins may also be supplied by users.<br>
